description: 'A web-based system that can be hosted in the cloud or on a local area
  network; there is no need for a license, so there is an unlimited number of simultaneous
  users

'
items:
- OpenBoxes is a web-based system that can be hosted in the cloud or on-premise. Either
  option requires a commitment from the implementing group, either to invest in sufficient
  human resources and hardware to support a locally-hosted system (online/offline
  capability), or to invest in consistent internet connectivity.
- Can be accessed from mobile devices
- Can be integrated with other software systems through REST API
- There are no limits to the number of users who can use the system at one time
