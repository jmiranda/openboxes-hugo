description: "You decide whether to deploy in the cloud or on-premise."
items:
- OpenBoxes is a web-based system that can be hosted in the cloud or on-premise. Either option requires a commitment from the implementing group, either to invest in sufficient human resources and hardware to support a locally-hosted system (online/offline capability), or to invest in consistent internet connectivity.
- Can be accessed from mobile devices
- Can be integrated with other software systems through REST API
- There are no limits to the number of users who can use the system at one time
