question: Does OpenBoxes offer any discounts for 501c3 organizations (non-profits, NGOs)?
answer: |
  Please contact us if you are a non-profit or small business that doesn't
  think they can afford the costs. We can work with you on your budget and/or reach out to some of our
  partners for alternative quotes. Provide details to our support team
  and we'll try to accommodate your budget constraints. We can also work with hosting providers to discount the cost of hosting. In fact,
  Azure, AWS and Google provide steep discounts that usually cover the cost of hosting
  and more.
