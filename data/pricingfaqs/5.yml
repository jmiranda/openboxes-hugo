question: Can I become a partner so that I can provide hosting and support to OpenBoxes users?
answer: |
  Yes, please. We don't have an official partnership agreement, but we'd love
  to promote companies that are willing to provide services to our users. Contribute to 
  [this discussion](https://discuss.openboxes.com/t/vm-with-openboxes/284)
  on our forum if you're interested in providing services. Once we get enough interest we'll add a page
  dedicated to service vendors.
