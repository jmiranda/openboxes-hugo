question: Why is Dedicated Support more expensive than Hosting?
answer: |
  Supporting software is time-consuming and expensive. In order to provide support to our users we need a team to
  cover our support hours even on days when there are no support requests.

  If our support packages are too expensive, we highly recommend that you use our
  [Community Support](/support#community) option until you need a guaranteed level of support.

  **NOTE:** We also encourage potential support partners who would like to
  offer support and hosting to reach out
