question: If OpenBoxes is "free" then why do I need to pay for hosting and support?
answer: |
  OpenBoxes, the software, is free to download and use. But unless you plan to install OpenBoxes on your personal laptop or desktop,
  you'll have costs associated with operating the software. Read our [Total Cost of Ownership guide](/cost-analysis) to better
  understand the costs associated with adopting and using OpenBoxes.
