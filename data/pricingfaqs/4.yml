question: How do I customize OpenBoxes?
answer: |
  There are basically two ways to customize the software

  1. Hire your own developers and contribute the code back to core (or to your own fork).
  2. Hire us and we'll take care of all the complexity of gathering requirements, developing, testing, and release
  your features.

  If you are interested in option (2) please contact us at [support@openboxes.com](support@openboxes.com) to discuss
  your requirements and we'll provide a proposal with a quote and timeline for your feature request.

  **NOTE** 
  
  Please take caution when maintaining your own fork. You could
  inadvertently end up in a situation where you lose the ability to pull the latest
  code from core into your fork. Don't hesitate to contact us for recommendations
  if you do go down this route.
