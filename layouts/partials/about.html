                        OpenBoxes is an open-source system developed by supply chain professionals working in resource-scarce
                        settings. As open-source software, OpenBoxes source code is available to use and modify at no charge
                        under the terms of the <a href="https://goo.gl/t9W3Sz">Eclipse Public License</a>
                        and can be configured and customized for interested parties to meet their
                        specific needs. Already existing functionality includes inventory tracking, lot and expiry
                        tracking, stock movement and shipment tracking, purchase orders, stock requisitions and
                        fulfillment, as well as built-in and customizable reports.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        OpenBoxes was designed specifically for low-resource settings where existing infrastructure for electronic inventory
                        management is limited. With minimal hardware requirements, flexible implementation options, an intuitive user interface,
                        and user-friendly workflows, the software provides immediate results for organizations working in challenging

                        environments who are looking for better inventory control and planning possibilities. While OpenBoxes was built to
                        address the specific needs of healthcare supply chains and supply chain staff in developing countries, new workflows
                        and functionality can and have been built to adapt to the needs of other contexts.

                    <p>
                        OpenBoxes is supported by a community of software developers and implementation specialists who have supply chain
                        expertise within the global health context. The OpenBoxes community is continually optimizing existing features and
                        developing new features to innovatively meet usersâ€™ needs. OpenBoxes community members are available to provide
                        implementation support, training (in English, French, and Haitian Creole), user manual creation, data migration,
                        software configuration and customization, software upgrades, hardware support, and supply chain consulting services.</p>
