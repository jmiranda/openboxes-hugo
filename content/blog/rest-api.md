We've created documentation for our fledgling REST API. Please check out the 
[API docs](https://docs.openboxes.com/en/develop/api-guide/)  
and then head over to [community.openboxes.com](https://community.openboxes.com) 
or [Slack](http://slack-signup.openboxes.com/) to discuss with our development team.

We are hoping to implement [OpenAPI/Swagger](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues/1129) 
docs soon. If you'd like to help with the migration, please start a discussion with me in the ticket.
