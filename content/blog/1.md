## October 2018

October 2018 is an exciting month for OpenBoxes with the implementation of Version 8. The software now features consolidated and automated workflows for all types of stock movements, the ability to partially receive a shipment, and a more flexible put away workflow. Automation includes selection of appropriate workflow for type of stock movement selected, suggested pick based on FEFO and quantity in bin, and data validation for substitutions and picking.
