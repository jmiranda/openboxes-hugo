In collaboration with Partners In Health, we have submitted a concept note for the
[Digital Square's Notice EO Phase 1 Shelf Readiness](https://applications.digitalsquare.io/notice-e0) 
project and we need your feedback. If you have suggestions on how you'd like to improve the installation, configuration 
and onboarding process of OpenBoxes, please head over to our 
[discussion forum](https://discuss.openboxes.com/t/push-button-deployment-new-user-onboarding/227) 
and let us know what you think. You can also add feedback directly to our [Concept Note](https://applications.digitalsquare.io/content/openboxes-shelf-readiness-project)
on the Digital Square website.
