## Stock Movement Search

The search function on the stock movement list page was previously not working properly all of the time. Now it should be fully functional:

## Receiving

* Fixed issue with receiving bins not appearing on certain incoming shipments: Certain incoming shipments were not going into receiving bins in locations that use bins. This has now been corrected.


* Users can now create receiving bins (using the same method as other bin locations)

* Users can now import a receipt from Excel.




## Putaway

* Users can now designate and view a “preferred bin” for each product.

    <img src="/img/screenshots/stock-card/preferred-bin-location.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Preferred Bin Location"/>

* Superusers can now delete pending putaways.

* Improved Putaway Report: Added a column for preferred bin. Made columns narrower to give more space to write notes in the putaway bin column and margins.

* Bug Fixes

    * Removed products appearing on create putaway that were not in the receiving bin
    * Stopped order of items changing between pages on the putaway workflow
    * Removed a pop-up that appears if the user puts away less than the full quantity


## Stocklist Management:

* Managers and Assistants can now view and print all stock lists. See the instructional video here. Coming soon for browsers!
* Bug Fixes:
    * Monthly replenishment quantity was generating strange numbers for lists that did not have a replenishment period. This is now fixed.
    * Updated by field on stocklist is now updating correctly (was not working before)



## Stock Movement Workflow:

* Save and exit button added to all pages of stock movement workflow. Clicking this button will return the user to the stock movement view page.

* Pressing the “back” button on a stock movement prompts an automatic save. This means that work entered on the current page will not be lost if you go back to the previous page.

* When a user edits a pick, the quantity originally picked will be visible in the popup modal
