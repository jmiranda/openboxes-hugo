## OpenBoxes 0.8.0 (in-progress)


It's been a few months since our last release (hotfix), but rest assured we are working on something big. We've been stuck on Grails 1.3.7 for several years, but I've started the arduous process of upgrading to Grails 2.5.5.

This change will be somewhat transparent to most users, but there are tons of bug fixes and performance improvements that will be unlocked by this upgrade. In addition, this will allow us to use a few more plugins (like spring security!) that will allow us to improve existing functionality and add new features.

In addition to the upgrade, we are also planning to add the following features in v0.8.0.
REST API Support:  Yes, we're finally going to add an API. Let us know if there are specific operations you would like to see supported.
Bill of Materials: Ability to define a Bill of Materials (comprehensive list of parts / components and quantities required to manufacture one unit of the BoM). This will allow us to support "manufacturing" use cases such as Crash Cart replenishment.
Upgrade Grails: <yawn> Really boring stuff here but will allow us to utilize new features within Grails to help improve current functionality as well as add new features.
