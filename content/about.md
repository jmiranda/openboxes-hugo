OpenBoxes is an open-source, web-based application developed by supply chain professionals working in resource-limited settings. As open-source software, OpenBoxes is available to use and modify at no charge under the terms of the Eclipse Public License (https://goo.gl/t9W3Sz) and can be configured and customized for interested parties to meet their specific needs. Already existing functionality includes, but is not limited to, inventory tracking, lot and expiry tracking, stock movement and shipment tracking, purchase orders, stock requisitions and fulfillment, as well as built-in and customizable reports.

OpenBoxes has been implemented in warehouses and hospital in Cameroon, Haiti, Malawi, Liberia,
and Sierra Leone, and has also been adapted for use by the private sector in the United States.

OpenBoxes was designed specifically for low-resource settings where existing infrastructure for electronic inventory management is limited. With minimal hardware requirements, flexible implementation options, an intuitive user interface, and user-friendly workflows, the software provides immediate results for organizations working in challenging environments who are looking for better supply chain management and planning possibilities. While OpenBoxes was built to address the specific needs of the global health supply chain, new workflows and functionality can and have been built to adapt to the needs of other sectors.

OpenBoxes is supported by a community of software developers and implementation specialists who have supply chain
expertise within the global health context. The OpenBoxes community is continually optimizing existing features and
developing new features to innovatively meet usersâ€™ needs. OpenBoxes community members are available to provide
implementation support, training (in English, French, and Haitian Creole), user manual creation, data migration,
software configuration and customization, software upgrades, hardware support, and supply chain consulting services.
