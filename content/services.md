# Services

<p>OpenBoxes, as open-source software, is free to <a href="/getting-started">download and use</a>. The software is therefore an attractive option for organizations with limited financial resources available to purchase licenses for proprietary software. At the same time, depending on existing resources and infrastructure, OpenBoxes may require some financial investment in human and information technology resources for a successful implementation. It is recommended that an organization evaluate the total cost of ownership (TCO) for any software under consideration, including the cost of hardware and personnel required for installation, implementation, maintenance, and custom development of the software. </p>

<p>Should an organization choose to consider OpenBoxes as their supply chain management software, community members can be contracted to design implementation plans and manage the software roll-out. These services include, but are not limited to the following. </p>

<p>In addition, service requirements and pricing can be determined based on the specific needs of the implementing organization. Please contact us at if you'd like to discuss your requirements. <p>
